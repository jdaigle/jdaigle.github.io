A couple of months ago I wrote about [searching for the ultimate dev laptop]({% post_url 2015-12-03-search-for-ultimate-dev-laptop %}). Today there are some updates, but I'm going to focus on the processors. In this case, I'm looking at the top-of-the-line model each:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model</th>
            <th>Family</th>
            <th>Number</th>
            <th>Speed/Cores</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Apple MacBook Pro 13" (early-2015)</td>
            <td>"Broadwell-U" (5th gen)</td><td>5557U</td><td>2 x 3.1GHz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Apple MacBook Pro 15" (mid-2015)</td>
            <td>"Haswell-H" (4th gen)</td><td>4980HQ</td><td>4 x 2.8GHz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dell Latitude E5470</td>
            <td>"Skylake-H" (6th gen)</td><td>6820HQ</td><td>4 x 2.7GHz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dell XPS 13</td>
            <td>"Skylake-U" (6th gen)</td><td>6560U</td><td>2 x 2.7GHz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lenovo T460s</td>
            <td>"Skylake-U" (6th gen)</td><td>6600U</td><td>2 x 2.6GHz</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Some notes:

* Apple has *still not released or announced* updated MacBook Pros. Hence, they are a generation behind.
* Dell has updated their Latitudes to latest processors. But the 6820HQ is technically the *older* Skylake-H.
* I'm now also comparing the Dell XPS 13. It's even smaller than the Latitude. It has Thunderbolt instead of HDMI. It's also touch, and perhaps a bit under-powered. But not severely. The biggest difference is that you can upgrade the HD and some other components. 
* Lenovo has also updated their T series. The Skylake-U is the "low power" processor.

So I'm still torn. I'm definitely going to wait and see what Apple does this summer.
