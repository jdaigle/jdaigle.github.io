## What is AMQP?

An acronym for the "Advanced Message Queuing Protocol". It is a [Standard (with a capital "S")](http://www.amqp.org/) application layer protocol defining a messaging protocol for message-oriented software. It's a **binary protocol wire-level protocol**. It describes the format and structure of data sent across the network. It's effectively peer-to-peer protocol, simply defining how two peers may exchange messages, *and not does define what roles the peers may or may not have*.

You can, for example, build a message broker. Or message queue. Or a gateway. Or an event bus. Or an "exchange".  You get the idea. It supports virtually any type of messaging topology.

This article aims to be update-able reference for those getting started with AMQP.

## The Protocol

Here is the [actual 1.0 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-complete-v1.0.pdf). It over 100 pages long, but it's a relatively quick read. The protocol specification itself is relatively simple and broken into several layers.

### Type System

AMQP implements it's own binary encoding for types. It define primitive types that map to many popular programming languages and platforms. This enables a high-degree of interoperability. It also supports composite types.

### Transport Layer / Link Protocol

Data is always transmitted across the wire in a *frame*. AMQP defines frames for various types of control messages (opening connections, starting sessions, attaching links, transferring messages, etc.).

1. **Connections** are usually *opened* over a reliable protocol such as TCP.
2. A **session** is *started* on a connection. A single connection may multiplex several independent sessions.
3. On a session, one or more uni-directional **links** are attached. Either peer may attach a link for sending or receiving. The link is attached, logically, to some terminus such as a queue.
4. Messages are *transferred* over links.

Since a single connection can multiplex multiple sessions and/or links, this means that network traffic can be streamlined. You don't need multiple connections.

### Messaging

The messaging layer covers:

* Message format. Including structure, properties, and headers.
* Delivery state for messages traveling between nodes. Messages need to be *settled* which ensures the sender and receiver agree on the state of the transfer.
* Sources and targets, and the states for messages stored at a distribution node. It also covers resumption of broken sessions and links.

### Transactions

The protocol supports transactions across transfers and distinct links in either direction. A transactions is first *declared* which establishes a transaction-id. Subsequent work is includes that transaction-id. At the end, the transaction is *discharged*, which will either commit or rollback the transaction.

### Security

You can encrypt the connection with TLS. Additionally, the protocol supports [SASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) to authenticate peers. Both protocols are be negotiated.

## Who/what uses AMQP?

Microsoft's Azure Service Bus supports AMQP. But not all Azure Service Bus features are supported over AMQP. The [client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.ServiceBus/) implements AMQP (it's not currently open source).

Microsoft does have an open source AMQP client library: [https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite](https://github.com/Azure/amqpnetlite). I believe that it's very similar to the implementation in WindowsAzure.ServiceBus.

The Apache Foundation has a number of open source projects: [Apache Qpid](https://qpid.apache.org/) and [Apache ActiveMq](http://activemq.apache.org/).

There are a number of other commercial and open source brokers, for example IBM MQ Light. But I don't know a lot about them.

And then there's [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). RabbitMQ is interesting because it is actually built on AMQP 0.9.1. That version was a pre-release and is a *very different* and basically incompatible protocol. There is a plugin to support AMQP 1, but it's marked as "experimental"!
