I'll be speaking at [SQLSaturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/EventHome.aspx) in Atlanta on May 21, 2016. This is really exciting since it's my first professional public speaking engagement.

My session is called [Data Access for Performance Junkies](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=48794). Subtitled "or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the ORM."

> ORM frameworks get a bad rap for their performance characteristics and complexity. But like any tool, it's all about learning to use correctly and intelligently. In this session we'll look at how application developers often use (and misuse!) these tools, and identify and correct problematic usage patterns. We'll also discover when it's appropriate to use an ORM, when it's not, and how incorporate "raw" SQL where it makes sense.
