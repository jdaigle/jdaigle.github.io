title: 'Hydrogen Extensions for ASP.NET MVC 5 Alpha Release'

I'm happy to share the first alpha release of my extensions library for ASP.NET MVC 5 which **adds support for async filters**.

You can download the library from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hydrogen.Extensions.Mvc5.Async) and the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jdaigle/Hydrogen.Extensions.Mvc5).

You can read about my journey to get here:

- [Part 2 - Refactoring AsyncControllerActionInvoker]({% post_url 2017-03-13-improved-async-aspnet-mvc-part-2 %})
- [Part 3 - Async Filter API]({% post_url 2017-03-18-improved-async-aspnet-mvc-part-3 %})

### Getting started

First we need to swap out the default implementation `IAsyncActionInvoker` with `Hydrogen.Extensions.Mvc5.Async.ControllerActionInvokerEx`. There are two ways to do this:

1) Set the `ActionInvoker` property of a controller when it's constructed:

    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public HomeController()
        {
            ActionInvoker = ControllerActionInvokerEx.Instance;
        }
    }

2) Using your DI container of choice, register `Hydrogen.Extensions.Mvc5.Async.ControllerActionInvokerEx` as an implementation of `IAsyncActionInvoker`.

For example (using Autofac):

    builder.RegisterInstance(ControllerActionInvokerEx.Instance)
            .As<IAsyncActionInvoker>()
            .SingleInstance();

Note that `ControllerActionInvokerEx` can be used as a singleton. It doesn't maintain any state.

### Creating an async filter

You may create a subclass of `AsyncActionFilterAttribute` or `AsyncExceptionFilterAttribute` and override the async methods.

For example:

    public class MyAsyncActionFilterAttribute : AsyncActionFilterAttribute
    {
        public override async Task OnActionExecutionAsync(ActionExecutingContext context, ActionExecutionDelegate next)
        {
            // Execute code before the action is invoked.
            // You can "short-circuit" the action by setting 'context.Result'
            // and returning before calling 'next()'.
            
            // The implementation is responsible for calling 'next()'.
            var actionExecutedContext = await next().ConfigureAwait(false);

            // Execute code after the action is invoked
        }

        public override async Task OnResultExecutionAsync(ResultExecutingContext context, ResultExecutionDelegate next)
        {
            // Execute code before the result is invoked.
            // You can "short-circuit" the action by setting 'context.Canceled = true'
            // and returning before calling 'next()'.
            
            // The implementation is responsible for calling 'next()'.
            var resultExecutedContext = await next().ConfigureAwait(false);

            // Execute code after the result is invoked
        }
    }

Alternately you may implement any of the async filters:

* `IAsyncActionFilter`
* `IAsyncResultFilter`
* `IAsyncExceptionFilter`
* `IAsyncAuthorizationFilter`

Unfortunately, for compatibility reasons, you must also implement the non-async version of these filters (e.g. `void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)`). However, these methods can be a NOOP since the code is never executed by `ControllerActionInvokerEx`.

This library, currently, does not implement as async version of `IAuthenticationFilter`.

### This is an alpha release

I fully expect to there to be bugs, however I hope to use it in real production code soon.

Maybe one day this code, or some derivation there of, can make it into an official release.

I hope someone else might find this library useful. And I'd appreciate feedback, comments, or contributions (including bug reports)!
